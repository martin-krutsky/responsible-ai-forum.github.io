We are an open discussion forum of people interested in ethical and responsible approaches to research and development of technologies in the areas of artificial intelligence, robotics, cybersecurity, and others (+). Our aim is to educate ourselves through a series of debates/discussions on interdisciplinary topics, such as professional ethics, AI safety, and regulation. We recognize that many of these topics are outside of our expertise, but we also recognize the need to be better informed in order to make better decisions in our professional lives. We are open to everybody (from academia, industry, as well as the general public) interested in these topics.

## Seminars
We will aim at approximately 1 public evening talk/discussion a month, conducted at the premises of Czech Technical University, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, at Charles Square 13 in Prague.
Details of each such event will be announced in advance through our online channels and (local) flyers.
